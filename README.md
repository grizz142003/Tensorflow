# Tensorflow
Learning and going through tensorflow documentation   
Using this opportunity to also learn how github works as well (2 birds with 1 stone)  

## Venv
Using A virtual environment with tensorflow installed. there is also other libraries such as pyplot used which are also installed in the Venv not sure how to integrate that whole folder to github so Im copy pasting the code over to the files in this repo for now  
Setting up the Venv is relatively simple follow along with the official tensorflow Documentation https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip

## TFdoc 4 ISSUE
when attempting to run the code inside TFdoc4 posted in this repo, you may run into an issue, this can be resolved by switching to google collab and running these 2 lines of code  
pip install tensorflow==2.13.0  
tensorflow-hub==0.13.0  
unfortunately I haven't figured out how to install older versions of tensorflow on my ubuntu machine, Moved onto the next learning document, will revisit later.
