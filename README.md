# Tensorflow
Learning and going through tensorflow documentation 
Using this opportunity to also learn how github works as well (2 birds with 1 stone)
## Using A virtual environment with tensorflow installed. there is also other libraries such as pyplot used which are also installed in the Venc not sure how to integrate that whole folder to github so Im copy pasting the code over to the files in this repo for now
